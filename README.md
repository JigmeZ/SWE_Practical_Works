## Lab 2
* Modify the program to count the number of unique words in the text.
* Add a function to find the longest word in the text.
* Implement a feature to count the occurrences of a specific word (case-insensitive).
* Create a function to calculate the percentage of words that are longer than the average word length.

## Lab 3
* Modify the iterative function to return a list of Fibonacci numbers up to n, instead of just the nth number.
* Implement a function that finds the index of the first Fibonacci number that exceeds a given value.
* Create a function that determines if a given number is a Fibonacci number.
* Implement a function that calculates the ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers and observe how it approaches the golden ratio.

## Lab 4
* Modify the linear search function to return all indices where the target appears, not just the first one.
* Implement a function that uses binary search to find the insertion point for a target value in a sorted list.
* Create a function that counts the number of comparisons made in each search algorithm.
* Implement a jump search algorithm and compare its performance with linear and binary search.

## Lab 5
* Implement a function that uses a stack to evaluate postfix expressions.
* Create a function that uses two stacks to implement a queue.
* Use a queue to implement a basic task scheduler that processes tasks in the order they were added.
* Implement a function that uses a stack to convert infix expressions to postfix.

## Lab 6
* Implement a method to find the middle element of the linked list.
* Create a method to detect if the linked list has a cycle.
* Implement a method to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
* Add a method to merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.

## Lab 7
* Implement a method to find the maximum value in the BST.
* Add a method to count the total number of nodes in the BST.
* Implement a level-order traversal (breadth-first search) for the BST.
* Create a method to find the height of the BST.
* Implement a method to check if the tree is a valid BST.

## Lab 8
* Implement an in-place version of Quick Sort to improve its space efficiency.
* Modify Bubble Sort to stop early if the list becomes sorted before all passes are complete.
* Implement a hybrid sorting algorithm that uses Insertion Sort for small subarrays in Merge Sort or Quick Sort.
* Create a visualization of how each sorting algorithm works using a library like Matplotlib.

## Lab 9
* Implement a method to find the shortest path between two vertices using BFS.
* Add a method to detect cycles in the graph.
* Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
* Create a method to determine if the graph is bipartite.
